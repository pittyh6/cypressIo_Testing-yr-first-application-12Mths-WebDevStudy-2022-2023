* Online courses, challenges and creation of my own projects.

## What I learned/used 
### Cypress 
* Best Practices
    * Getting elements
        * Do not select by id's or classes. Use data attributes. (data hyphen test attribute: [data-test='nameDataTest'])
            * the ids and classes can change, and you cypress test is going to stop working.
